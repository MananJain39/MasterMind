#  Mastermind – Terminal Edition
---

A terminal-based version of the classic code-breaking game *Mastermind*, built purely in Python. The computer generates a secret code, and you aim to crack it within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, you receive feedback to help guide your next move:

*  Digits that are correct **and** in the correct position
*  Digits that are correct but in the **wrong** position

Use logic and deduction to reveal the hidden code before you run out of tries!
